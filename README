### Example usage:

You can ban players in a variety of interesting ways. Have a look at the examples below:

- /ban -p MrChuckles - (ban MrChuckles permanently without a reason)
- /ban -t HarryField 1 day (ban HarryField for one day without a reason)
- /ban -t HorribleGriefer 3 months (same as above but this time for 3 months)
- /ban -fp TerryTibbs Testing the plugin (ban the offline player TerryTibbs permanently with a reason)
- /ban -ft TerryTibbs 2 weeks (ban the offline player TerryTibbs for two weeks)

You can check the ban history of a player to see how many times they have been banned before. Here are some examples:

- /banhistory -a MrChuckles - (check if MrChuckles has any active bans)
- /banhistory -A MrChuckles - (show all of MrChuckles bans even if they have expired)

You can also choose to pardon players in the same way; -a for active bans and -A to pardon all bans.

- /pardon -a MrChuckles - (pardon MrChuckles and delete any active bans)
- /pardon -A MrChuckles - (delete all of MrChuckles bans even if they have expired)
