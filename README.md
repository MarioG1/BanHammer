# BanHammer 

A plugin for the Bukkit framework that allows adminstrators and other trusted users to ban and kick players. The basic idea is to have a lightweight banning solution that includes all the features you help manage your server. Additionally the plugin stores all bans using the Bukkit persistance system, using permissions for all commands and is simple to configure.

## Requirements

- Bukkit Persistence needs to be configured in bukkit.yml
- If using MySQL for Persistence, you need a MySQL database
